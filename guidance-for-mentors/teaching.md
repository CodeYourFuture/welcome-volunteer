# Teaching

To access this specialised track at CYF, trainees must already have demonstrated aptitudes in **X, Y, AND Z,** so you can and should expect a high standard in these areas.&#x20;

The 'lesson' for each topic is not designed to be a taught lecture, but a short introduction to the ideas the trainee will explore themselves in coursework and then apply in the practical.

Teaching should take the form of practical projects, workshops, and personal challenges, _not lectures_. Trainees on this track are organised and self motivated adult learners; if you want to give them a lecture, send them your Youtube video. :wink:&#x20;
