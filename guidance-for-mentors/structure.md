# Structure

This track is organised more like our post-graduate modules, grouped around six key topics or themes instead of weeks. This is because trainees may join this track at different times so it doesn't make sense to timebox explicitly.&#x20;

However, the **maximum** time a trainee _could_ have to complete the course is **12 weeks**, not including the Final Project, as they can only join this track after [completing JS3.](https://syllabus.codeyourfuture.io/Overview) This means the coursework cumulatively can take no more than **240 hours** to complete.&#x20;
