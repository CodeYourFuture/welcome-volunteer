# Overview

The purpose of this onboarding is to give you a brief introduction to the most important topics for volunteering at CodeYourFuture. 

In this onboarding, you will watch some short videos (or read descriptions) of four key topics. 

Afterwards, we have a short (and easy) quiz to ensure that you remember the fundamentals as you start your volunteer journey. 

Don't worry, the quiz is REALLY simple, and even if you don't get it right, you can still volunteer with us! You'll see what we mean when you get there. 

## Four key topics to start volunteering at CodeYourFuture

1. Values
2. Ways of working
3. Community Safety / Code of Conduct
4. Slack intro

Lets get started!
